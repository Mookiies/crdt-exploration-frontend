### Running

To run this front end of the POC use.

`yarn start`

This will run on localhost:3001

This expects to use the backend rails app here: https://github.com/Mookiies/crdt-exploration

Setup for that repo is running basic rails commands:
`rails db:create db:migrate` and the `rails s`. Backend runs on localhost:3000


### Code tour
The code tour lives inside the `.tours` directory. Currently there is only one `intro-walkthrough` tour. 
This requires that you have the codetour plugin for vscode.
