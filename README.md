To run this front end of the POC use.

`TSC_COMPILE_ON_ERROR=true yarn start`

This will run on localhost:3001

This expects to use the backend rails app here: https://github.com/Mookiies/crdt-exploration

Setup for that repo is running basic rails commands:
`db:create + migrate` and the `rails s`. Backend runs on localhost:3000
